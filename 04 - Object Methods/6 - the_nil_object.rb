# nil is like null, nothing in it
# nils is a object, it store in memory and 
# having it own method

puts nil
p nil

  nil is display nothing only when you use
  put method
  The rule when using Object is you alway need
  something to return back, but when there is nothing
  to return, it will return nil
  
  ==> nil is an object represent nothing, blankness
  It's basically means storing nothing

Everything is true, except nil

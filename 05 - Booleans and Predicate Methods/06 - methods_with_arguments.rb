puts "Big Mac".include? "B" # true
puts "Pizza".include? "A" # false

# Ruby is case-sensitive

# How to look for many value? I still dont know :)
# puts "Big Mac".include? ("A", "B")
# puts "Big Mac".include "A", "B" still wrong tho

# Also i've found out a new way to using puts
# instead of puts "Value" 
puts "Big Mac", "Cheese", "Pizza"

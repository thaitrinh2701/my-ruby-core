**WHAT IS RUBY?**

Ruby is an object-oriented programming language that can be set up on all modern operating systems. It was first developed and released in 1995 by **Yukihiro Matsumoto**, also known as Matz. You can find his GitHub profile here: [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://github.com/matz).

The official website for the Ruby programming language is available here: [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

**WHY RUBY?**

Ruby focuses on programmer productivity and simplicity. Its syntax is much simpler than that of other programming languages, making it easier to write and understand code. Due to its emphasis on programmer happiness, Ruby may have slower execution speed compared to languages like Java or Python. However, while Ruby might be slower, it is not inherently slow.

**RUBY ON RAILS**

Ruby on Rails (often referred to as RoR or Rails) is a popular web development framework built on top of Ruby. It was developed by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), whose GitHub profile can be found here: [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://github.com/dhh).

It’s important to note that Ruby and Rails are different technologies: Ruby is the programming language, and Rails is a framework that requires Ruby to function.

**RUBY INSTALLATION**

To install Ruby, visit the official RubyInstaller website: [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and download the latest version with the DevKit.

After installation, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ruby -v
```
**Recommended VSCode Extensions:**

 - Code Runner: Easily run your Ruby scripts from within VSCode.

 - Ruby Extension Pack by Shopify: Provides enhanced Ruby language support in VSCode.

**Hello Ruby Example:**

Here’s a simple Ruby script to print "Hello Ruby":

```bash
puts "Hello Ruby"
```

To run the code from the terminal, use the following command:

```bash
ruby file_name.rb
```

This repository is based on the Udemy course ["Learn to Code with Ruby"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/) and other Ruby tutorials available on YouTube.

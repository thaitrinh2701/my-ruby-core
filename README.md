This is my personal Ruby Core learning repository. 

**WHAT IS RUBY?**

Ruby is an object-oriented programming language and can be setup on all modern operating
Ruby was first developed and release in 1995 by **Yukihiro Matsumoto**, who also known as Matz 
(https://github.com/matz)

**WHY RUBY?**

Ruby is focused on programmer productivity and simplicity. Its syntax is much simpler than other programming language
Because of focus on programmer hapiness, it has slower speed compare to other language like Java, Python, .... But Ruby is slower, not slow



**Ruby on Rails**

Ruby on Rails (or RoR, Rails) is a popular web development framework built on top of Ruby
Rails was developed by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)
